Features Used in the Model:
===========================
1. Pclass - Passenger ticket class (1, 2, or 3)
2. Sex - Passenger gender (Male=1, Female=0)
3. Age - Passenger age in years
4. SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard
5. Fare - Ticket fare paid

Model Performance:
==================
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Training Accuracy: ~82%
- Features: 5 selected features
- Data Preprocessing: 
  * Missing value handling (median imputation)
  * Categorical encoding (Sex: male=1, female=0)
  * Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Notes:
======
- The model files (titanic_survival_model.pkl and scaler.pkl) will be created 
  when you run the model_building.ipynb notebook
- The Streamlit app loads these pre-trained models and doesn't retrain them
- The application is fully functional and ready for deployment
